# Login1

This project is a simple login screen built using the Flutter framework, designed to allow users to log in with their email and password. The primary goal of this project is to serve as a fun and educational exercise to familiarize yourself with Flutter's widget system and state management.

Features:
Email and Password Fields: Two text fields for users to input their email and password, complete with validation to ensure proper input formats.
Login Button: A button that triggers the login process, with placeholder functionality for future backend integration.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and web applications.
Modern UI: Clean and modern user interface with a focus on usability and simplicity.
This basic login screen serves as a foundational component for more complex applications, providing a starting point for further development and experimentation with Flutter.
